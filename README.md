# U.R.Lucky

The Book about How the network works. Read it [here](https://keepwow.github.io/URL/).

## How do I build this?

- I use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for its simplicity.
- I switched to [material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) theme for its multi-language support.
- The brief build logs are kept in `mkdocs.md`.
